Open Db.dbml. 

Clear all

Reimport all tables

Rebuild, run the test "RemoveLinqChildRelations" in "DbXmlAssociationSetterTester"

The test also sets cardiality between goal and trainingplan to "One"

Now do this

The trick is:

Make the changes you want in the dbml file (this is done in "RemoveLinqChildRelations"), and save it, 
if the designer did not regenerate the code:
Rename the dbml file (for example Db.dbml to Db2.dbml)
Make a copy of it (Drag it to the same folder)
Now rename the New file to the original name.
while renaming I found that the designer has regenerated the code file 

Finally run the macro "SetVersionAndRefIDPropertiesInternal" hiding properties from WebOrb
